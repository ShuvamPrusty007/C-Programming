Hey Shuvam,

I know the journey is challenging, but it's far from 
impossible. Keep pushing forward with determination and focus.
Your goal is to land a great job at a top company with a 
high salary and you can absolutely achieve that within the 
next two months.

Give it everything you've got. Stay consistent, stay 
disciplined, and believe in your potential. The effort you 
put in today will shape the success you celebrate tomorrow.

You've got this. Keep going!
